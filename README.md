## DQN Model for Stock Trading
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model for trading stocks. The model is trained and evaluated on a stocks: JPMorgan Chase (JPM).

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a reinforcement learning model using DQN to optimize stock trading strategies. The model is trained to make buy, sell, or hold decisions based on historical stock data and other financial indicators.

## Features
Deep Q-Network (DQN) Implementation: Uses TensorFlow to build and train the DQN model. 
Stock Data Retrieval: Utilizes yfinance to fetch historical stock data.
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for data normalization and splitting into training and testing sets.
Performance Visualization: Plots and visualizes the model's trading performance over time.

# Usage

* Imports: Import necessary libraries.
* Data Loading: Fetch historical stock data using yfinance.
* Data Preprocessing: Normalize data and split into training and testing sets.
* Model Building: Define and compile the DQN model using TensorFlow.
* Training: Train the model on the selected stocks.
* Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the results.
